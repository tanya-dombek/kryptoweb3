# Krypt - Web 3.0 Blockchain Application
![Krypt](https://i.ibb.co/DVF4tNW/image.png)

Web 3.0 Blockchain React App with Solidity and Smart Contracts:

- In this app I connected a regular React.js application to the blockchain and paired it to my Ethereum wallet using MetaMask.
- I've learned how to write Smart Contracts on the Ethereum network using the Solidity programming language.
- I've learned how to create a full-fledged Web 3.0 application that allows users to send transactions through the blockchain.
